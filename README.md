Numerical solution of Schrodinger equation by interesting approach and back propagation technique
particle_in1Dpotential.pdf file contains mathematical expression of this method.

This code trying is find minimum energy wavefunction by changing k points of given random initial wavefunction in given 1D potential energy box using cost function and back propagate to find necessary k points. 

Warning: this is not an efficient way of solving Schrodinger equation, but this approach aids to gain an intuitive background for Density Functional Theory.

For the record: I will make changes about back prog tehcnique.
